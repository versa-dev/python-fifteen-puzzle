The 15-puzzle game is constructed with 15 sliding tiles, each with a different number from 1 to 15, with all tiles packed into a 4 by 4 frame with one tile missing. The object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles so that they are ordered as below:

| 2 | 3 | 4 | |
| 1 | 5 | 7 | 8 |
| 9 | 6 | 10 | 12 |
| 13 | 14 | 11 | 15 |

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| 13 | 14 | 15 | |

Given the initial configuration of a 15-puzzle, devise a function that will determine a sequence of steps that will take you to the final state. You are limited to using at most 50 steps to solve the puzzle. If the puzzle is not solvable, return -1.

Example: (0 is the blank position)
2 3 4 0
1 5 7 8
9 6 10 12
13 14 11 15
